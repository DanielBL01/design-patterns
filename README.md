1. [Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/)

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification (Open-Closed Principle)
6. Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes (Dependency Inversion Principle)
